# Browser Engineering

Ryan takes on https://browser.engineering!

This codebase is in somewhat desparate need of a refactor, but I'm holding off on that until I've finished the book so my code structure matches the book's.

I'm generally completing all the exercises that seem like an interesting challenge, but avoiding some that I feel will need to be reworked in future chapters.

I'm using Pyright for strict type checking so I've deviated from the book's code in a few places to express more information in type annotations.
